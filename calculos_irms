This voltage is measured relative to the processor supply voltage (in this case 3.3 V), which is used as the reference
The reference voltage would give the maximum count of 2 exp10 ( = 1024).

Var = 3,3 * (count/1024)

Ratio = Ipr / Isec

Isec = Var/R

=================
pri ----- sec
100 ----> 50e-3

ratio = 2000
=================

Ipr = Isec * Ratio

Ipr = (Var/R) * Ratio

Ipr = ((3,3 * (count/1024))/R) * Ratio

Ipr = ((3,3* (count / 1024))/18) * Ratio

Ipr = (count * 3,3 * Ratio)/(1024 * 18)

Transformation relation for SCT-013-030
current constant = 30 ÷ 1 = 30

Transformation relation for SCT013-000
current constant = (100 ÷ 0.050) ÷ 20,5 = 97,6

Transformation relation for SCT036TS 600A:0.1A
current constant = (600 ÷ 0.100) ÷ 10 = 600

Transformation relation for SCT036TS 160A:0.04A
current constant = (160 ÷ 0.040) ÷ 10 = 400

Transformation relation for SCT036TS 160A:0.04A
current constant = (160 ÷ 0.040) ÷ 20,5 = 195,1

Transformation relation for SCT024TS 400A:0.1A
current constant = (400 ÷ 0.1) ÷ 20,5 = 195
